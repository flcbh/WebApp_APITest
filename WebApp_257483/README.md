# Web API Test

This is a simple API that I made as a test and demonstration of my knowledge of software development using the .Net Platform.

This API was built to my understanding of the requirements, as there was no form of validation.



## API Reference

```
  Test Browse https://localhost:7143/swagger/index.html

```
  GET https://localhost:7143/api/Values/1029TH/5}
```
